## OlÃ¡! :clap:

I am an aspiring cosmologist interested in using data to uncover the universe's evolution. My primary research interest is developing new methods and numerical tools to obtain cosmological information. In my spare time, I enjoy reading "boring books", hiking, and playing with my dog, Mel.

## Research Interests

- Isotropy testing;
- Testing general relativity;
- Developing tools to improve the efficiency of heavy calculations (integration, special functions, sampling methods, . . .) to decrease computation time.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

- My master's thesis.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

- SQL.
